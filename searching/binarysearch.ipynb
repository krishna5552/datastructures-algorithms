    "Binary search is a fundamental algorithm used to efficiently find an element in a sorted array or list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, comparing the target value to the middle element, and narrowing the search to the appropriate half. The time complexity is O(log n), making it much faster than linear search for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variations of Binary Search:**\n",
    "- **Finding the first or last occurrence:** Useful when the array contains duplicate elements and you need the position of the first or last instance.\n",
    "- **Searching in a rotated sorted array:** Common in interview questions where the array has been rotated at some pivot.\n",
    "- **Binary search on answer:** Used in problems where you search for the minimum or maximum feasible value, such as optimization problems (e.g., finding the minimum capacity to ship packages within D days).\n",
    "- **Lower and upper bounds:** Finding the smallest index where a condition is true (lower bound) or the largest index where a condition is true (upper bound).\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Binary Search:**\n",
    "- The data must be sorted or monotonic (increasing or decreasing).\n",
    "- When you need efficient search, or to find boundaries (first/last occurrence, lower/upper bound).\n",
    "- In optimization problems where the solution space can be searched using binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip for Interviews:**  \n",
    "Always clarify the problem constraints and edge cases. Be ready to adapt the standard binary search to handle variations like duplicates, rotated arrays, or custom conditions. Understanding these variations is key to solving many real-world and interview problems efficiently."
